# üöÄ **Complete CI/CD Setup Guide for Dine with Locals**

I'll give you a step-by-step roadmap that covers the core parts without overwhelming complexity. This will get you a solid CI/CD pipeline that automatically tests, builds, and deploys your app.

## **üìã Overview: What We'll Build**

```
Developer pushes code ‚Üí GitHub ‚Üí Automatic Testing ‚Üí Build ‚Üí Deploy ‚Üí Live App
```

**What you'll achieve:**

- ‚úÖ Automatic testing when code is pushed
- ‚úÖ Automatic deployment to staging and production
- ‚úÖ Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
- ‚úÖ Easy rollbacks if something breaks
- ‚úÖ Monitoring and notifications

---

## **üéØ Phase 1: Foundation Setup (Day 1-2)**

### **Step 1.1: Set Up Environment Variables**

**Why:** Keep secrets safe and manage different environments

**What you'll do:**

1. Create environment configuration files
2. Set up development, staging, and production environments
3. Learn about environment variable management

**Files to create:**

- `.env.example` (template for team)
- Environment-specific configs for each stage

### **Step 1.2: Add Basic Testing Framework**

**Why:** Catch bugs before they reach users

**What you'll do:**

1. Add Jest for backend testing
2. Add Vitest for frontend testing
3. Write a few basic tests for critical functions
4. Set up test scripts

**Example tests:**

- User authentication
- API endpoints
- Database connections
- Component rendering

---

## **üîß Phase 2: GitHub Actions Setup (Day 3-4)**

### **Step 2.1: Create Basic CI Pipeline**

**Why:** Automatically test every code change

**What happens when you push code:**

```
1. Code pushed to GitHub
2. GitHub Actions triggers
3. Install dependencies
4. Run linting (code quality check)
5. Run tests
6. Build the application
7. Report success/failure
```

**You'll create:**

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml` - Main testing pipeline
- Quality gates that prevent bad code from being merged

### **Step 2.2: Set Up Deployment Pipeline**

**Why:** Automatically deploy working code

**What happens after tests pass:**

```
1. Tests pass ‚úÖ
2. Build application
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Run integration tests
5. (Manual approval for production)
6. Deploy to production
```

---

## **üåê Phase 3: Hosting & Deployment (Day 5-6)**

### **Step 3.1: Choose Hosting Platforms**

**Recommended simple setup:**

**Frontend (React):**

- **Platform:** Vercel or Netlify
- **Why:** Free, automatic deployments, CDN included
- **Setup:** Connect GitHub repo, automatic deployments

**Backend (Node.js):**

- **Platform:** Railway or Render
- **Why:** Free tier, easy database integration, automatic deployments
- **Setup:** Connect GitHub repo, set environment variables

**Database:**

- **Platform:** MongoDB Atlas (you're already using this)
- **Why:** Managed, reliable, free tier

### **Step 3.2: Environment Setup**

You'll create three environments:

1. **Development** - Your local machine
2. **Staging** - Testing environment (mimics production)
3. **Production** - Live app users see

**Each environment has:**

- Separate database
- Different API URLs
- Different environment variables

---

## **üìù Phase 4: Detailed Implementation Steps**

### **Day 1: Environment & Testing Setup**

**Morning (2-3 hours):**

1. **Create environment templates**

   ```bash
   # You'll create these files
   .env.example
   client/.env.example
   server/.env.example
   ```

2. **Install testing frameworks**

   ```bash
   # Commands you'll run
   npm install --save-dev jest vitest @testing-library/react
   ```

3. **Write your first tests**
   - Test user login
   - Test API endpoint
   - Test component rendering

**Afternoon (2-3 hours):** 4. **Set up test scripts in package.json** 5. **Run tests locally to make sure they work** 6. **Create simple test data/mocks**

### **Day 2: GitHub Actions Basics**

**Morning (2-3 hours):**

1. **Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`**

   - This file tells GitHub what to do when code is pushed
   - Install dependencies
   - Run linting
   - Run tests
   - Build application

2. **Test the pipeline**
   - Push code to GitHub
   - Watch the pipeline run
   - Fix any issues

**Afternoon (2-3 hours):** 3. **Add quality gates**

- Prevent merging if tests fail
- Code coverage requirements
- Linting must pass

4. **Set up branch protection rules**

### **Day 3: Staging Environment**

**Morning (2-3 hours):**

1. **Set up Railway/Render account**
2. **Create staging deployment**
3. **Configure environment variables**
4. **Connect to staging database**

**Afternoon (2-3 hours):** 5. **Set up automatic staging deployment**

- When code is pushed to `develop` branch
- Automatically deploy to staging
- Run smoke tests

### **Day 4: Production Environment**

**Morning (2-3 hours):**

1. **Set up production hosting**
2. **Configure production environment variables**
3. **Set up production database**
4. **Configure custom domain (optional)**

**Afternoon (2-3 hours):** 5. **Set up production deployment pipeline**

- Manual approval required
- Deploy when code is pushed to `main`
- Health checks after deployment

### **Day 5: Monitoring & Notifications**

**Morning (2-3 hours):**

1. **Set up basic monitoring**
   - Uptime monitoring
   - Error tracking
   - Performance monitoring

- Slack/Discord for deployment status
- Email for critical failures
- GitHub notifications

### **Day 6: Documentation & Refinement**
